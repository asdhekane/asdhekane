### 🚀 My Projects & Experience

#### 🤖 [Agentic AI System for Autonomous Threat Response](https://github.com/asdhekane/agentic-cybersec)
- Architected a multi-agent AI cybersecurity system on the MCP framework to automate the full incident response lifecycle.
- Leveraged a pre-trained LLM (distilgpt2) to perform NLP-based threat analysis and generate autonomous countermeasures.
- The system is designed to reduce threat response latency from minutes to seconds.

#### 🏢 Software Engineering Intern @ Dover India Innovation Center
- Architected and implemented a full-stack web application that automated domain categorization, **reducing manual effort by over 90%**.
- Utilized a BERT-based NLP engine, improving classification precision by over 50%.
- Developed the application using Python FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, incorporating secure authentication with MSAL and Platform IDM.
- Handled NGINX deployment for high-performance web serving.

#### ⚡ Parallelising DMRG (High-Performance Computing)
- Accelerating Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) computations for quantum simulations using GPU parallelism with CUDA.
- Benchmarking various kernel designs to optimize throughput on CUDA-enabled devices.

#### 🌐 Microservices & Data Pipelines @ Software Tree
- Engineered microservices to enable seamless data migration between relational and NoSQL databases.
- Built robust data pipelines from local JSON sources, leveraging native APIs for reliable integration.
